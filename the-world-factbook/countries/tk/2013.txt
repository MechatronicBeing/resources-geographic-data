Central America and Caribbean :: Turks and Caicos Islands (overseas territory of the UK) Introduction :: Turks and Caicos Islands B a c k g r o u n d: The islands were part of the UK's Jamaican colony until 1962, when they assumed the status of a separate crown colony upon Jamaica's independence. The governor of The Bahamas oversaw affairs from 1965 to 1973. With Bahamian independence, the islands received a separate governor in 1973. Although independence was agreed upon for 1982, the policy was reversed and the islands remain a British overseas territory.
